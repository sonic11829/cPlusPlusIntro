helloWorld.cpp
  * Integer - Whole number.
  * Double - Number including a decimal.
  * Single Character - A or B or C or $ or 1 or 2 or 3 etc.
  * Boolean - True or false.
  * String - Objects that represents a sequence of text. std::string
  * Standard - std::
  * Character - c
  * Output - out
  * std::cout - Standard character output

helloWorld2.cpp
  * Constant - The const keyword specifies that a variable's value is constant.
              Tells the compiler to prevent anything from modifying it, which makes it read only.

helloWorld3.cpp
  * Namespace - provides a solution for preventing name conflicts
                in large projects. Each entity needs a unique name.
                A namespace allows for identically named entities
                as long as the namespaces are different.

helloWorld4.cpp
  * Typeof - reserved keyword used to create an additional name
            (alias) for another data type.
            New identifier for an existing type
            Helps with readability and reduces typos
            Use when there is a clear benefit
            Replaced with 'using' (work better w/ templates)

helloWorld5.cpp
  * Arithmetic - arithmetic operators = return the result of a specific arithmetic operation (+ - * /)
                 order of operation = parenthisis > multiplication & division > addition & subtraction

helloWorld6.cpp
  * type conversion = conversion a value of one data type to another
          Implicit = automatic
          Explicit = Precede value with new data type (int)

helloWorld7.cpp
  * character input - cout << (insertion operator), cin >> (extraction operator)
                      #include <string> was used to use the getline() function

helloWorld8.cpp
  * few basic math functions - max displays the highest value, in this case 4 because y = 4.
                               min displays the lowest value, in this case 3 because x = 3.
                               pow or power displays the hights power of the first number using the second number. -
                               - In this case it's 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 or 2 to the power of 4 which is equal to 16.
                               sqrt or square-root displays the square root of the number passed into the parrenthesis.
                               abs or absolute value, if you pass in a negative value you will be given the positive version of that number
                               round round a number to the closest whole number, in this case it will be 3 because 3.14 is closes to 3.
                               ceil or ceiling rounds a number up to the closes whole number, in this case 4.
                               floor rounds a number down to the closes whole number, in this case 3.

helloWorld9.cpp
  * the hypotenuse of a triangle - 'c' = the squareroot of 'a' squared + 'b' squared
