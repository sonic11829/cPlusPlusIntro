helloWorld2.cpp
  * Constant - The const keyword specifies that a variable's value is constant.
              Tells the compiler to prevent anything from modifying it, which makes it read only.

helloWorld3.cpp
  * Namespace - provides a solution for preventing name conflicts
                in large projects. Each entity needs a unique name.
                A namespace allows for identically named entities
                as long as the namespaces are different.

helloWorld4.cpp
  * Typeof - reserved keyword used to create an additional name
            (alias) for another data type.
            New identifier for an existing type
            Helps with readability and reduces typos
            Use when there is a clear benefit
            Replaced with 'using' (work better w/ templates)

helloWorld5.cpp
  * Arithmetic - arithmetic operators = return the result of a specific arithmetic operation (+ - * /)
                 order of operation = parenthisis > multiplication & division > addition & subtraction

helloWorld6.cpp
  * type conversion = conversion a value of one data type to another
          Implicit = automatic
          Explicit = Precede value with new data type (int)

helloWorld7.cpp
  * character input - cout << (insertion operator), cin >> (extraction operator)
                      #include <string> was used to use the getline() function
