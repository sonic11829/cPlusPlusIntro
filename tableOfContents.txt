            Helps with readability and reduces typos
            Use when there is a clear benefit
            Replaced with 'using' (work better w/ templates)

helloWorld5.cpp
  * Arithmetic - arithmetic operators = return the result of a specific arithmetic operation (+ - * /)
                 order of operation = parenthisis > multiplication & division > addition & subtraction
